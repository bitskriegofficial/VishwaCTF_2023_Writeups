## CID
- We are provided with an image `case69.jpg`. Nothing much in the picture, but reveals a password on checking metadata. Tried steghide with password, nothing
- Tried `binwalk`, reveals a `7z` file. Extracted it, and found several images with a text file. Text file of not much use
- All the images were of same size, except one `369.jpg`
- On applying `steghide` with the password found in metadata - ***"daya darwaza tod do"*** we get `flag.txt`

## I am an Investigator
- We are given a corrupted image `RealFirst.png`. As we can see the header reads `BHAI` :)
- I fixed the magic bytes to `89 50 4E 47` and got the image
- The image talks about ***Latitude*** & ***Longitude*** as being the length and breadth of the image respectively **(in cm)**
- I checked the metadata of the image using `exiftool`
