- The dialogue in the `.mp3` file is from the movie ***Zameen***
- On opeining the TOI page of the movie, we found 2 reviews from the user `Kshitij Narkhede32`, who seems to be from the VishwaCTF team, he mentions about the flag format
- He also mentions about all the movies of the director - **Rohit Shetty** & that the actual movie earned 229 Cr more i.e. 11 + 229 = **240 Cr**
- On checking the box office collections of all the movies by him, we get `Simmba`, released on 28th December 2018
